# ChessBoard
Simple chessboard generator for command line- taken from Eloquent JavaScript chapter 1 project.

Creates, using spaces and #, for example: 

 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #

with a default of an 8 x 8 example if no other number provided.
Could be improved as I haven't used any Math function and it uses a square root- at the time of writing, I haven't learned how to use these.
